<h1>Let's change the way people use electric scooters!</h1>
<p>For last two years they can be found everywhere - on sidewalks, streets, UBahn stations, our backyards, <br
>parks and even polluting the water in canals and lakes! It is time to bring some order and introduce rules that will <br>
make our streets safer for all, the scooter users included! Scooters lying everywhere can post a danger for cyclist and other users of the streets.
The solution is simple - docking areas where the scooters should be parked! Do you agree and like this idea? Please sign.</p>
